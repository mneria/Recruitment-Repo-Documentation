For inquiries, please read the application FAQs and Home Study FAQs. If you still have unanswered questions, please send an email to apply@andela.com.

#Stage 1: Application and Aptitude Assessments
First you’ll complete a free application so we can learn more about you. We adminster a series of psychometric tests and IQ evaluations to gauge problem solving ability and aptitude, since both of these skills are cornerstones of what makes a successful Andelan.

#Stage 2: Passion Check & Self-Learning Ability
Qualified applicants are assigned a self-study programming curriculum to measure drive and discipline. This takes the form of an introduction to software development self-study course focused on Python. During the course, you’ll complete a Proctor test that will evaluate your knowledge of the content you’ve learned (hence, our way of measuring your learning ability). You will also be invited to a Slack community called ‘Open Andela’ to help guide and encourage you throughout the process.

#Stage 3: Personality Match via Face-to-Face Interviews
Selected candidates are invited to in-person interviews made up of staff members and fellows at an Andela campus. At this stage, we focus on our ability to gauge soft skills and personality fit.

#Stage 4: Programming Evaluation during Training Bootcamp
Successful applicants participate in a two-week, full-time bootcamp at an Andela campus led by senior developers. You’ll be expected to learn independently as well as work on a team to deliver a final project. We’re looking for programming aptitude (which is both a combination of your work product and your learning ability), work ethic, passion and teamwork. 

#Stage 5: Acceptance into Andela
The highest performing candidates will be accpeted into our four-year Technical Leadership Program. 

To qualify for this, candidates must demonstrate soft skills (strong communication skills--because trust and rapport are essential), technical expertise (Stack-specific knowledge and a creative approach to problem solving), adapbtability (experience with a variety of tools and technologies to tackle the unknown), and hands-on experience (Building real products – because true problem solvers learn by doing.)
